Regex is not supported.\nEmpty form query: Empty form_query lists your forms.\nSubmission inquiry: When search_submissions is true, submission_inquiry is REQUIRED and must contain a non-empty natural language string. Empty submission_inquiry will return an error when searching submissions.\nToggles: Use search_forms and search_submissions to include forms and/or submissions in the result. limit controls the number fetched per underlying request.\nExamples: (1) form_query=[\"invoice\"] to find forms; (2) form_id=\"123\" and submission_inquiry=\"payments above 100 usd\" to find matching submissions in that form; (3) form_query=[\"order\"], submission_inquiry=\"customers requesting refunds\" to search submissions only within forms whose titles match \"order\".",
